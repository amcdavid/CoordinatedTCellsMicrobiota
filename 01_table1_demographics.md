``` r

## Any Milk (in hospital)

``` r

```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 3
    ##   ispreterm     n  prop
    ##   <lgl>     <int> <dbl>

``` r

```

    ## cols(
    ##   Subject = col_character(),
    ##   `Sequence Num` = col_double(),

milk_sum = milk %>% group_by(Subject) %>% dplyr::summarize(months_surveyed = n()*3, milk_months = mean(milk_months/3, na.rm = TRUE)*12, any_milk_quarter = mean(`Did baby receive breast milk since last visit`=='Yes', na.rm = TRUE)*4)

write_csv(milk_sum, path = 'intermediates/milk_subject.csv')
```

These values were reported to the study by the infantsâ€™ caregiver in a
quarterly survey

### Months of \> 50% human milk

``` r
milk_sub = left_join(milk_sum, subject)
```

    ## Joining, by = "Subject"

``` r
calc_stat(milk_sub, quo(milk_months))
```

    ##   ispreterm  mean    sd
    ##   <lgl>     <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 FALSE      5.35  4.53
    ## 2 TRUE       3.02  3.50

Months that the child recieved \> 50% human milk (normalized to one year
of follow up)

### Quarters of milk

``` r
calc_stat(milk_sub, quo(any_milk_quarter))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 3
    ##   ispreterm  mean    sd
    ##   <lgl>     <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 FALSE      1.86  1.68
    ## 2 TRUE       1.04  1.36

Number of 90-day periods in which any milk was
recieved.

``` r
#latex(summary( ispreterm ~ milk_months + any_milk_quarter, data = milk_sum, method = 'reverse', test = TRUE, prmsd = TRUE, continuous = 3))

ggplot(milk_sub, aes(x = preterm_weeks, y = milk_months)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

age.

## Antibiotics

``` r
nabx_polish = left_join(nabx_polish, subject)
```
